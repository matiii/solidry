# Solidry
Main purpose of Solidry is developing SOLID and DRY code with minimalistic library on which mediator pattern is over-engineering. Library allow add new functionality such as cross-cutting concerns in SOLID way, putting extensibility on the stage.

# Main goals
1. Simplicity

Every component in library should be easy to understand by Developer. To achive it architecture of library has to be consistent,      contains   only simlpe mechanisms which allow develop maintainable code.

2. Extensibility

Components should be easy to extend if functionality require it.  

3. Replaceability

Components should be easy to replace without modification of current code.

4. Durability

Components should be testable and simultaneously well tested to avoid error prone.
