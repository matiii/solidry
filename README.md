## Main goals
#### Simplicity
Every component in library should be easy to understand by Developer. To achive it architecture of library has to be consistent,      contains only simlpe mechanisms which allow develop maintainable code.

#### Extensibility
Components should be easy to extend if functionality require it.  

#### Replaceability
Components should be easy to replace without modification of current code.

#### Testability
Components should be testable and simultaneously well tested to avoid be error prone.
